*   This program is meant to display graphics on projectors
*   making a laser-show when accompanied by music and a hazer (smoke machine)
*   The whole point is making it better than the already existing MusicBeam
*   which uses microphone input. This is trash as it is impossible to foresee
*   when the song is building up for an eventual drop. The solution is to analyze
*   the whole song b4 playing it and displaying graphics. This makes it possible
*   to reduce horrible lag and create a better dramaturgy in the whole song.
